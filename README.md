# Planet-Money-Pod-Downloader

I found it difficult and time consuming to download archived Planet Money podcasts, so I wrote a small scraper to do it for me.

Run the script from the command line, entering the start and end date of the podcasts you want to download:
`python pm_podder.py 1-1-2012 12-31-2012`
